• Journeys to most MEDIUM travel risk areas – including the capital Riyadh, Dammam
(Eastern province) and Jeddah – can continue with standard precautions.
• Journeys to strategic locations, such as government and military interests, oil facilities
and airports, in the MEDIUM travel risk areas of Asir, Jizan and Najran provinces within
68 miles (110km) of the border with Yemen should be for essential purposes only.
Monitor events closely during your stay in these areas.
• Avoid non- essential journeys to the HIGH travel risk areas within 18.6 miles (30km) of
the border with Iraq and Yemen. Essential travel to these locations should be
conducted only with a trusted bilingual local guide, ideally with a strong local contact
network, and with solid journey- management plans. Defer all travel to Najran city and
its immediate surroundings due to the heightened threat of indiscriminate cross- border
strikes.
• Exercise heightened caution around likely targets for Houthi attacks. These include
government and military interests, energy infrastructure and airports. Remain indoors
and take cover under or behind a hard surface if an explosion is heard, as falling debris
from a missile or drone interception can pose risks to those in the vicinity.

• International SOS maintains its standing advice to defer all travel to Myanmar due to
restrictions related to COVID- 19. The driver for this advice now applies equally to the
prevailing security situation, until otherwise indicated. This assessment is made jointly
by our medical and security professionals.
In-country workforce
• Essential movement should be carried out after liaising with local contacts to confirm
the status of routes and feasibility of travel due to potential roadblocks. Unrest may
occur with little warning, even in areas that are not traditionally protest hotspots.
Backup plans should also be in place in the event that the journey is interrupted,
including potential safe havens en route to the destination.
• Stand fast in a safe location if in the vicinity of unrest. Should protesters or the security
forces begin to gather in your vicinity, vacate the area to minimise the risk of injury,
head to a safe haven immediately and remain there until the situation has stabilised.
• Before conducting any intercity movement or movement outside major urban centres,
seek a profile- and itinerary- specific risk assessment from security professionals to
ensure appropriate precautions, taking into account the potential for short- notice
imposition of restrictions on road movement, access to certain areas and
communications services.
• Expect heightened security on the streets especially in the capital Naypyitaw,
Mandalay (Mandalay region) and Yangon. C arry relevant identification documents to
ease passage through security checks.
• Installations affiliated to the ruling military State Administration Council (SAC), including
military, police, and local administrative buildings and personnel, are common targets
of explosions and EAO attacks. Minimise time spent in the vicinity of these locations to
mitigate the risk of getting caught up in any incident.
• Maintain heightened awareness in public spaces, especially in the vicinity of parked
vehicles or publicly accessible containers such as rubbish bins , due to the threat of
hidden explosives.
• Be prepared for further short- notice disruption to telecommunications services.
Maintain a list of emergency contacts, both electronically and on paper. Always keep
copies with you. Register all contacts on your mobile phone. Ensure that you are aware
of and compliant with your organisation's communications and incident management
protocols. Check in or communicate your status and whereabouts during and after any
period of communications disruption.
• Power cuts are expected in the coming weeks. Ensure your accommodation has a
backup generator and all communication devices are fully charged as a general
backup generator and all communication devices are fully charged as a general
precaution.
• Ensure you have the ability to stand fast for a protracted period with access to secure
accommodation, tested communications procedures and a resilient local assistance
network. Ensure access to adequate stocks of essential supplies, including food, water,
backup power, fuel, cash and essential medication.
• Those travelling near ongoing protests face the risk of arbitrary detention and incidental
injury. The police may stop you for questioning, check identification and conduct
searches of electronic devices for politically sensitive material.
• Continue to monitor developments closely. All information circulating on social media
and news channels should be verified via reliable sources.
Health advice from International SOS
• Obtain profile- specific advice prior to any travel, taking into account the extent to which
your age and health may make you more vulnerable to the COVID- 19 virus. Review
the necessity of travelling against the potential risks.
• Do not travel if you are sick. People who are sick risk being tested and quarantined.
Monitor your health and seek medical attention if you develop flu- like symptoms,
following the local procedure for your location.
• Pay strict attention to hygiene. Wash your hands frequently and carry hand sanitiser for
use when soap and water are not readily available. Wear a mask whenever you are

Managers
• Closely monitor COVID- 19- related developments for impacts on staff mobility or
associated security risks.
• Ensure access to reliable, nuanced information to inform workforce communication and
business decision-making.
• Regularly re- evaluate whether it is best for your international assignees and
dependants to remain in- country or to relocate. If you decide to relocate them, this
should be done as soon as possible.
• Consider the circumstances that influence their ability to remain in- country and work
with the restrictions, directives and mitigation measures of the authorities. These
include:
o The ability to procure basic goods and services.
o Access to communications.

health system’s capability to manage a sudden surge in demand.
o The ability and comfort level of international assignees to stay for an extended period
at their destination with limited or no support.
• Ensure the strict compliance of your workforce with local government containment
efforts. Contact the local authorities to reconfirm the zonal classification (containment
or non- containment) of your sites and whether your business operations are permitted
accordingly.

The U.S. Embassy in Bogota reports that the following protests have been planned across
Bogota for Wednesday, May 19:
8:00 AM local time Demonstration at Portal Americas
8:00 AM Demonstration at Parque Virrey
9:00 AM March starting at Parque Nacional; ending point unknown
10:00 AM March starting at Portal del Sur and proceeding to Estado el Campin

2:00 PM Demonstration at Monumento a los Heroes
The pubic is advised to closely monitor local media outlets, as additional bouts of protest
activity could potentially crop up with little or no warning. Widespread protest activity has
continued on a daily basis since late April. What began as a series of demonstrations
against a proposed tax reform initiative has since broadened into a much wider protest
movement. Many activists have demanded that the country s riot police force (the Mobile
Anti-Disturbances Squadron, or ESMAD ) be dismantled following a series of incidents in
which officers have been accused of using excessive force. Student groups, labor unions,
indigenous organizations, and a range of other activist groups also continue to take to the
streets to raise disparate grievances spanning issues such as healthcare, wealth
inequality, and working conditions.
Protests have repeatedly degenerated in wider episodes of unrest, sometimes entailing
looting, arson, roadblocks, and/or violent clashes with security forces. Dozens of bus
stops remain out of service throughout Bogota and its environs due to recent vandalism.
All large public gatherings should be avoided as much as possible to minimize the risk of
being caught up in incidental violence. Motorists are advised not to attempt to bypass
roadblocks, as doing so could elicit a violent response from protesters.

arrested-june-4-anniversary
New Updates:
Media sources indicate that thousands of police forces have been deployed to Victoria
Park from 4:00 PM local time on Friday, June 4, to 12:00 AM on Saturday, June 5, to
prevent demonstrators from gathering. An annual demonstration has been held at Victoria
Park in the past on June 4 to commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre;
thousands of protesters of protesters attended the vigil in the past. The vice-chairperson
of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, Chow
Hang-tung, was arrested on Friday morning local time for allegedly promoting the banned
Tiananmen vigil. It is not immediately clear if demonstrators will turn out this year due to a
recent ban on gatherings. Avoid the area and expect associated disruptions in the vicinity.
Previous Updates:
Demonstrations across Hong Kong initially broke out in June 2019, originally called by the
Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), in opposition to a proposed law allowing extraditions to
mainland China. While the extradition bill was withdrawn, the CHRF and its supporters
expanded their demands to include the release of detained protesters, the resignation of
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, an investigation into police responses to the
protests, universal suffrage for local elections, and retraction of the use of the word riot to
describe the protests. In 2020, demonstrators have also protested a national security law
for Hong Kong passed by the Chinese central government and a ban on insults to the
Chinese national anthem. Some demonstrations in 2019 saw participation levels as high as
several hundred thousand or more than one million; however, the size and frequency of
protests have declined this year due to the COVID-19 outbreak and greater government
restrictions on the protest movement. Individuals are advised to monitor developments
and to avoid any demonstrations due to the potential for clashes.
